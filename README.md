Budget Tracker

This is a project that uses node.js, express.js, Mongoose, MongoDB, service workers and manifests to create an installable offline experience.
The service worker allows for cashed content to be presented and the IndexDB allows the user to continue to add transactions while offline.
Finally the manifest allows the user to even install the application to their phone or desktop.
